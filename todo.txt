change tile colors to brown/dark brown or make it easier to see white pieces on the lighter tiles
instead of adding a purple border to possible tiles, maybe add a small dot in the center of the tile if you can move there (chess.com/lichess do it like this, its kinda nice but you could do it differently if u want)
make purple outline slightly bolder/darker (might remove need for previous bullet)
pre-moves (you can select a move when its not your turn, and if that move is still legal once the opponent goes, it automatically makes that move for you)
clocks/timers
scores (+- numbers) (if youre up a pawn, it shows +1, if youre up a knight it shows +3, etc)
could highlight opponents last move
